This repo is the code submitted for AAAI 2022 to review, not the final project. 
The complete project will be released once the paper is accepted. 

Plus, once the paper is submitted, we will also upload the graph function to Pypi (see the gicopy repo)

pip install -r requirements.txt
python test.py
python visulization.py
